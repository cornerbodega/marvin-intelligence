          I wanted to save the good stuff
        </h2>

        <p style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          When I first used ChatGPT, I thought it was great. Too great to waste.
          I wanted an easy way to save and organize what I was reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had been working on creating a business plan and it kept forgetting
          the name over time. I started saving the ChatGPT output in Google
          Sheets and had the idea to make links between reports. Rather than
          that, why not just make a website?
        </p>
        <p>
          I wonder if it can return HTML. It can! So I saved the output as html
          and added links myself. Of course, this was caveman cumbersome. If I
          could automate this process in a web app, then I could have a
          dynamically-genrated choose-your-own-adventure wiki page.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            What if every time a report is written, it's assocaited with a
            particular agent with a particular memory and specialization and
            perspective?
          </li>
          <li>
            What if the whole thing was automated? What if I could have the
            agents decide what to research and write next, recursively?
          </li>
          <li>
            Wouldn't that give me the ability to start and read a blog about
            anything I want, instanteneously, and completely customized to my
            interest?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          What if there were pictures and it read to me? That would be awesome.

          Recruit GPT Agents to write reports

        <h3 style={{ marginBottom: "15px" }}>Reports</h3>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Start by pasting content from ChatGPT or other sources. An AI agent
          will analyze the content and generate a report. You can review and
          provide feedback on the report. Once you approve it, the agent will
          create a wiki-style page for you. This page is fully editable and
          shareable.
        </p>

        <h3 style={{ marginBottom: "15px" }}>Continuum & Deep Linking</h3>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Highlight any text in a report and click the <strong>+</strong>{" "}
          floating action button. This opens a prompt where the agent will guess
          what kind of linked report you need. You can edit or replace the
          prompt. The agent will generate a new report based on the prompt,
          factoring in the highlighted text, the linked report, and the agentâ€™s
          previous reports. The new report will automatically link back to the
          original via a hyperlink on the highlighted text.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          The Continuum button simplifies this process by recursively generating
          deeply linked reports with shared context.
